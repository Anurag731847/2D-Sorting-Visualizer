# 2D-Sorting-Visualizer
This is a simple 2D Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates how a sorting algorithm (Bubble Sort) works by animating the process in real time. Each array element is represented as a vertical bar, and the algorithm visually swaps them step-by-step.
